# Technical Interview Practice Porject

The file `solutons.py` has solutions of five problems.
Functions question1 to question5 are the solutions.
Each function uses additional helper functions and classes.

The file `solutions.py` doesn't include test cases. Instead, tests
are writtn in the file `tests.py`. To test the code, run the tests.


## Usage

To run all tests:

```
python tests.py
```

or

```
python -m unittest tests
```

To run individual tests:

```
python -m unittest tests.TestQuestion1
python -m unittest tests.TestQuestion2
python -m unittest tests.TestQuestion3
python -m unittest tests.TestQuestion4
python -m unittest tests.TestQuestion5
```
